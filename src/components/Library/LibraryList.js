/* ========== LIBRARY LIST ============= 

â€¢ Library List: Use dynamic interpolation to render a "Q", "X", or "Z" library view. 
Render list by importing LibraryCard. For each card, render a delete button
that deletes the selected word from the words dataset. Re-render library view upon click, fetching
updated word list.

  - Stretch: Filter results by listing words in the following ways [array methods]:
    ~ aplhabetical/reverse alphabetical
    ~ chronological/reverse chronological
    ~ by word length (shortest first)
    ~ starts with letter/has letter

  - Stretchier: Filter results for Q words with no U as a bonus feature/nav link [array method or fetch call]

  - Stretchiest: Filter search results, removing capitalized words, phrases and hyphenated words, [array methods]
    and then verify words for wordgame viability by using Merriam-Webster API [add to ERD: verified boolean]*/
